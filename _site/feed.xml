It was printed in Pest, 1866. While in general not of any particular interest, what stands out is the way 
Targum Unkelus is replaced for a German translation which they referred to as Targum Ashkenazy.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The translation was done by &lt;a href=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5120-dessauer-julius&gt;Yehuda/Julius Halevi Dessauer&lt;/a&gt; 
who apparently translated a few other books as well.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Side note: Moses Mendelssohn's family name was originally Dessaur until he had it changed to Mendelssohn. I guess both families originated from Dessau.

It is always interesting to see the names and families that were included. Many times these rulers were not particularly favorable to 
the Jews, nevertheless they were included. Seeing those names in print adds a 
sense of realism and history to these 100 year old siddurim. I’m sure there are siddurim from far more interesting locations with unique or

First is Siddur Tefilas Yisroel, printed in Copenhagen 1917. 
Fairly straight forward, but always interesting to see Sefarim from less typical European areas. 
While quickly flipping through it I noticed that at the end of bentching there's a note to say &quot;Yiru es Hashem&quot; silently. 
Not a big deal, just something that stood out, as it's not mentioned in today's standard bentchers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


Next is a Seder Haftoros also printed in Copenhagen but from 1894. It has each week's haftorah along with the Danish translation. 
The first few pages are a list of names with the header &quot;Subskribentfortegnelse&quot; which seems to mean a writers list of some sort 
(google translate was no help; spelling must be off or maybe it needs to be broken down to multiple words?). 
Both translations seem to have been originally done by Rabbi Abraham Alexander Wolf. You can see in the hebrew introduction to the 
siddur that his fathers name was Alexander.

- the first head of the military Rabbinate of the IDF. 
The book is mostly taken from a long interview the author had with R Goren in which R Goren is very straight forward and explains 
the logic behind many of the decisions he made as head of the Rabbinate in the IDF as well as later on as Chief Rabbi of Tel-Aviv 
and then as Chief Rabbi of Israel. In addition, there are many minor but interesting anecdotes about life in Israel and the Rabbonim 
in Yerushalayim from pre 1948 through the six day war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to shabbos, kashrus and burials (three of the main focuses of the IDF Rabbinate) the Rabbinate also prints Siddurim, 
Machzorim, Haggadahs, Megillas ect for the IDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is an IDF Siddur from 1963; note the abbreviated Shmona Esrei that's included for davening during an emergency. 
Also, on the title page it has 'Nussach Achid' which was a nusach Rabbi Goren implemented as a single nusach everyone in the Army 
would use. It is a combination of nusach Ashkenaz, Ari and S'fardi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is an IDF machzor printed for Rosh Hashanah 1949 - &quot;The second year of the State of Israel&quot;. Rabbi Goren's name is still Goronchik - 
which is what it originally was until Ben-Gurion asked him to modernize it and remove the &quot;chik&quot;.

A couple of cute postcards - would be really cool to have one that actually has a hand written message.... 
Apparently these were given to the soldiers as they returned to America; they'd send them to their families letting them know 
they were back on American soil and were heading home. Interesting details about the different types of postcards

If you're lucky, you can find one with a name &amp; rank or some note written on the inside cover.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Jewish German Almanac 1935 &amp;amp; 36 - Almanach des Schocken Verlags</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Jewish-German-almanac-1930s" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Jewish German Almanac 1935 &amp;amp; 36 - Almanach des Schocken Verlags" /><published>2020-09-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-09-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Jewish%20German%20Almanac%201935</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Jewish-German-almanac-1930s">This wasn't an extremely interesting find, but still cool. It's a pair of Jewish almanacs in German from 1935 and 1936. 
There seems to be a range of essays on different aspects and topics of Judaism and Zionism. One page that was particularly 
interesting was the list of global Jewish occupancy in the 1936 pamphlet (last image below). The almanacs were published by 
Schocken Verlag - a publishing company founded and owned by Salman (Zalman) Schocken. Salman eventually moved to 
Palestine and purchased the Ha'aretz newspaper. His descendants still have a 60% stake in the paper. You can read more about him

Although this is not a particularly old book, it is a commemorative album which seems somewhat hard to come by. In addition, I found the hour by hour narrative super fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

The following four sefarim are not from the DP camps but rather from Shanghai and from Mir in NY right after the war. Hopefully I'll do some future posts on WW II subject matter, with some sefarim printed by the American army for their soldiers, some Yidish and Hebrew books about the concentration camps written right after the war, and some general sefarim printed in the DP camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Ramban&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number one is a soft cover Ramban that says printed by Mir. The seller insisted it was printed in Shanghai, although I can't find any reference to that in the sefer itself. Lesson learned - be more vigilant and only buy something you can verify, at least to some minimal extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Shita Mekubetzes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is a shita mekubetzes on Nedarim printed by Yeshivas Mir in NY in 1947. Rabbi Avroham Kalmonowitz writes a very nice introduction about the importance of torah and how when the yeshiva was in Shanghai during the war and had extremely little to live on, they spent whatever they could to print sefarim.  The same when they came to NY; printing sefarim was one of the first things they did - even before they had a building for the yeshiva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Maayana Shel Torah&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is &quot;Torah Kval&quot; (Mayana shel Torah) in Yiddish, (two volumes; Bereishis, Shemos &amp; Vayikra in one and the last two in the second volume) printed by Agudath Yisroel in Shanghai 1945. A couple of notes. 1. It has a clear name - seems it belonged to a Yechiel Efraim Halevi Shainwack.  2. This printing was dedicated to the author of the sefer who was killed by the Nazis in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943. 3. In the back of the first volume there is a gift note from a friend who signs off &quot;Your brother in pain&quot; 1946. It's hard to make out the complete name of the gifter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Gemarah&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last is a Gemara Bechoros printed in Shanghai in about 1942. What is interesting is that it has a hand written name - Avroham Arbuz with a date, 8 Cheshvon 5703 (October 19, 1942). It then has a stamp that this sefer was from the property of the Bachur Avroham Yitzchak Yisroel Ben Tzvi Arbuz, a talmid of Mir who was niftar on 13 Shevat 5706 (January 15, 1946) in Shanghai. Sad. Couldn't find much online about this Arbuz, other than his name on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.archives.jdc.org/multimedia/Documents/Names%20Databank/Mirrer%20Yeshiva/Additional%20Links/Complete_AR33-44_00053_00960.pdf&quot;&gt;list of Mir talmidim&lt;/a&gt; (page 4 - number 97) and that apparently there are a plenty more sefarim with his name out there, as many people online also mention having sefarim with his name.&lt;/p&gt;
