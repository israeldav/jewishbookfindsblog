by the JWB (Jewish Welfare Board) and distributed to Jewish military personnel.  Siddurim, Machzorim, Tanachs, Haggadahs, Megillas and many 
other books/pamphlets/Jewish guides were printed by the thousands and are fairly easy to pick up today. If you're lucky, you can find one 
with a name &amp; rank or some note written on the inside cover.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are some of the basics:

A couple of cute postcards - would be really cool to have one that actually has a hand written message.... 
Apparently these were given to the soldiers as they returned to America; they'd send them to their families letting them know 
they were back on American soil and were heading home. Interesting details about the different types of postcards

Although this is not a particularly old book, it is a commemorative album which seems somewhat hard to come by. In addition, I found the hour by hour narrative super fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

The following four sefarim are not from the DP camps but rather from Shanghai and from Mir in NY right after the war. Hopefully I'll do some future posts on WW II subject matter, with some sefarim printed by the American army for their soldiers, some Yidish and Hebrew books about the concentration camps written right after the war, and some general sefarim printed in the DP camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Ramban&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number one is a soft cover Ramban that says printed by Mir. The seller insisted it was printed in Shanghai, although I can't find any reference to that in the sefer itself. Lesson learned - be more vigilant and only buy something you can verify, at least to some minimal extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is a shita mekubetzes on Nedarim printed by Yeshivas Mir in NY in 1947. Rabbi Avroham Kalmonowitz writes a very nice introduction about the importance of torah and how when the yeshiva was in Shanghai during the war and had extremely little to live on, they spent whatever they could to print sefarim.  The same when they came to NY; printing sefarim was one of the first things they did - even before they had a building for the yeshiva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Maayana Shel Torah&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is &quot;Torah Kval&quot; (Mayana shel Torah) in Yiddish, (two volumes; Bereishis, Shemos &amp; Vayikra in one and the last two in the second volume) printed by Agudath Yisroel in Shanghai 1945. A couple of notes. 1. It has a clear name - seems it belonged to a Yechiel Efraim Halevi Shainwack.  2. This printing was dedicated to the author of the sefer who was killed by the Nazis in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943. 3. In the back of the first volume there is a gift note from a friend who signs off &quot;Your brother in pain&quot; 1946. It's hard to make out the complete name of the gifter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Gemarah&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last is a Gemara Bechoros printed in Shanghai in about 1942. What is interesting is that it has a hand written name - Avroham Arbuz with a date, 8 Cheshvon 5703 (October 19, 1942). It then has a stamp that this sefer was from the property of the Bachur Avroham Yitzchak Yisroel Ben Tzvi Arbuz, a talmid of Mir who was niftar on 13 Shevat 5706 (January 15, 1946) in Shanghai. Sad. Couldn't find much online about this Arbuz, other than his name on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.archives.jdc.org/multimedia/Documents/Names%20Databank/Mirrer%20Yeshiva/Additional%20Links/Complete_AR33-44_00053_00960.pdf&quot;&gt;list of Mir talmidim&lt;/a&gt; (page 4 - number 97) and that apparently there are a plenty more sefarim with his name out there, as many people online also mention having sefarim with his name.&lt;/p&gt;
