I"Ú<p>Below are some pages from a Yiddish magazine printed in the DP camps in 1948. 
It provides a very clear and unique insight to their day to day life - similar to picking up a newspaper today and 
flipping through it; you walk away with a straightforward snapshot of that day, not someone writing 50 years later 
trying to reconstruct a bygone era. Since it was a magazine though, the paper quality is terrible and it is really 
crumbling apart. When I bought this one there was an identical copy also available - don't know what I was thinking 
but I just took the nicer of the two and left the second one there. Live and learn.... The last page is an index of 
the articles in thisÂ issue. Overall it is very heartening to see the strength and courage that was displayed so soon 
after the war...</p>

<p>PS - There was no way this wasn't going to entirely fall apart if I kept it at home. I sent it to Amudai Aish in Brooklyn, hopefully they have some 
benefit from it.
