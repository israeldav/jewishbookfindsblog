I"ø<p>I'd like to continue last post's focus on material from post WW II. The following fourÂ sefarim areÂ not from the DP camps but rather from Shanghai and from Mir in NY right after the war. Hopefully I'll do some future posts onÂ WW II subject matter, with some sefarim printed by the AmericanÂ army for their soldiers, some Yidish and Hebrew books about the concentration camps written right after the war, and someÂ general sefarim printed in the DP camps.</p>
