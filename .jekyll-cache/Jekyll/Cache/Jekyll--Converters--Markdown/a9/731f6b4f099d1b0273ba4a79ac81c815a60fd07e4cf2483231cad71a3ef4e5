I"o<p>These notes byÂ Rabbi Moshe Sherer are from the commemorative album put out by Agudath Israel of America in 1999 - 
Rabbi Moshe Sherer, his life and his legacy. They detail Rabbi Sherer's efforts to get the last Jewish hostages of 
the 1970 TWA hijacking (&lt;a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson%27s_Field_hijackings&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson%27s_Field_hijackings&lt;/a&gt;) home in time for Rosh Hashana.

Although this is not a particularly old book, it is a commemorative album which seems somewhat hard to come by. In addition, I found the hour by hour narrative super fascinating.</p>
