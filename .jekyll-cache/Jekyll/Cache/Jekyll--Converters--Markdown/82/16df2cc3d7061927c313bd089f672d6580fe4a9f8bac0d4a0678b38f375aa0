I"š<p>I recently read an &lt;a href=https://www.amazon.com/Might-Strength-Autobiography-Shlomo-Goren/dp/1592644090/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=61309f-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00072BSS4&amp;linkId=4d3aaa1f25c3f7b255535ae44cc4354b&gt;autobiogrophy&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Goren&gt;Rabbi Shlomo Goren&lt;/a&gt; 
- the first head of the military Rabbinate of the IDF. 
The book is mostly taken from a long interview the author had with R Goren in which R Goren is very straight forward and explains 
the logic behind many of the decisions he made as head of the Rabbinate in the IDF as well as later on as Chief Rabbi of Tel-Aviv 
and then as Chief Rabbi of Israel. In addition, there are many minor but interesting anecdotes about life in Israel and the Rabbonim 
in Yerushalayim from pre 1948 through the six day war.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition to shabbos, kashrus and burials (three of the main focuses of the IDF Rabbinate) the Rabbinate also prints Siddurim, 
Machzorim, Haggadahs, Megillas ect for the IDF.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is an IDF Siddur from 1963; note the abbreviated Shmona Esrei that's included for davening during an emergency. 
Also, on the title page it has 'Nussach Achid' which was a nusach Rabbi Goren implementedÂ as a single nusach everyone in the Army 
would use. It is a combination of nusach Ashkenaz, Ari and S'fardi.</p>
