I"(<p>I recently picked up these two sefarim with Danish translation. First is Siddur Tefilas Yisroel, printed in Copenhagen 1917. 
Fairly straight forward, but always interesting to see Sefarim from less typical European areas. 
While quickly flipping through it I noticed that at the end of bentching there’s a note to say “Yiru es Hashem” silently. 
Not a big deal, just something that stood out, as it’s not mentioned in today’s standard bentchers.</p>
