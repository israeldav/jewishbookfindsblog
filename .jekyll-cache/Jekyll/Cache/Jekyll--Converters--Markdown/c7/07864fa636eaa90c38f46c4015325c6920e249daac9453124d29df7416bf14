I"ë<p>Some of the most popular paraphernalia from Jewish soldiers serving in WW I and WW II (and the Korean war?) are books that were printed 
by the JWB (Jewish Welfare Board) and distributed to Jewish military personnel. Â Siddurim, Machzorim, Tanachs, Haggadahs, Megillas and many 
other books/pamphlets/Jewish guidesÂ were printed by the thousands and are fairly easy to pick up today. If you're lucky, you can find one 
with a name &amp; rank or some note written on the inside cover.</p>
