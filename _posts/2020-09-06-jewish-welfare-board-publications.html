<p>Some of the most popular paraphernalia from Jewish soldiers serving in WW I and WW II (and the Korean war?) are books that were printed 
by the JWB (Jewish Welfare Board) and distributed to Jewish military personnel.  Siddurim, Machzorim, Tanachs, Haggadahs, Megillas and many 
other books/pamphlets/Jewish guides were printed by the thousands and are fairly easy to pick up today. If you're lucky, you can find one 
with a name & rank or some note written on the inside cover.</p>

Here are some of the basics:

A couple of cute postcards - would be really cool to have one that actually has a hand written message.... 
Apparently these were given to the soldiers as they returned to America; they'd send them to their families letting them know 
they were back on American soil and were heading home. Interesting details about the different types of postcards
