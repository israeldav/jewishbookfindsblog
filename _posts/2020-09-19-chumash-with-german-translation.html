This Chumash Bamidbar contains just chumash and rashi along with a German translation for each.
It was printed in Pest, 1866. While in general not of any particular interest, what stands out is the way 
Targum Unkelus is replaced for a German translation which they referred to as Targum Ashkenazy.
<p></p>
The translation was done by <a href=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5120-dessauer-julius>Yehuda/Julius Halevi
    Dessauer</a> 
who apparently translated a few other books as well.
<p></p>
Side note: Moses Mendelssohn's family name was originally Dessaur until he had it changed to Mendelssohn. I guess both
families originated from Dessau.
