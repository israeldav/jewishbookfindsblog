<h1>
    Summary of my recent visit to Norfolk area old synagogues and cemeteries
</h1>
<p></p>

<p>Below are seven historic synagogue buildings and cemeteries in Norfolk and Portsmouth VA that I visited in April of 2021. 

This post if not about the history of these locations, rather its intent is to serve as a guide for others visiting Norfolk who are interested in visiting these Jewish historic locations. 

I will include whatever information I could quickly find online, but I did not attempt to contact any of the locations in an attempt to view the interiors or get them unlocked. 

1. Chevra T'hilim 607 Effingham St, Portsmouth, VA 23704. The building is easy to find. 
When I drove by, it was closed and locked. 
The synagogue was opened in 1922 and is no longer in use. 
See <a href=http://www.norfolkhistory.com/chevrathelim.htm>here</a> for a great deal of information about Chevra Thilim and <a href=https://www.jewishmuseumportsmouth.org/>here</a> about the current state of the building which seems to have been converted to a Jewish museum.

2. Gomlei Chesed 519 County St Portsmouth, VA 23704. The building is currently a Knights of Columbus and is easy to find. I looked briefly and was unable to find a corner stone which makes sense as according to <a href=https://www.lva.virginia.gov/chancery/full_case_detail.asp?CFN=740-1901-052#img><u>this document</u>u></a> (click the 'next' link to go to page 5) the building was originally a church and was purchased by the Jewish congregation in 1901.

3. Chevra Thilim and Gomlei Chesed Cemetery 3508 Bellport Ave, Portsmouth, VA 23704.
The cemetery is across the street from the above address. The cemetery is L shaped going from Bellport Ave to George Washington Highway. The Bellport side is Chevra Thilim and the George Washington entrance is the Gomlei Chesed part. The door to the cemetery was not locked.

5. Mikro Kodesh Synagogue 411 E Liberty St, Norfolk, VA 23523. 
The building is now the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith. It's easy to find. 
The corner stone reads "Erected 1921". I did not notice a Star of David, but there were Kohanim hands high up on the front of the building.

6. Mikro Kodesh Cemetery 3133 Kemet Rd, Chesapeake, VA 23325. The path that leads to the cemetery is across the street from the above address. The back of the cemetery is slightly visible from Berkley Ave but there's a fence and no gate with lots of overgrown bushes. The cemetery was locked.

7. Bnai Israel/United Orthodox Synagogue 463 Spotswood Ave, Norfolk, VA 23517. The building is easy to find. It is in use as an orthodox synagogue. The building was originally United Orthodox synagogue which was a merge of the Twentieth Street Synagogue and Kâ€™hal Chasidim from downtown. Although a lot of rooms have been added and the synagogue campus has been expanded, the main sanctuary is the original United Orthodox building. Corner stone reads "United Orthodox Synagogue 1946". See more on the <a href=http://bnaiisrael.org/2017/08/08/a-brief-history-of-our-congregation/><u>synagogue's website</u></a>.
