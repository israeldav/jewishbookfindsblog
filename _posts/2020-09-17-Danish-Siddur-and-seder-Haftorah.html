I recently picked up these two sefarim with Danish translation. First is Siddur Tefilas Yisroel, printed in Copenhagen
1917.
Fairly straight forward, but always interesting to see Sefarim from less typical European areas.
While quickly flipping through it I noticed that at the end of bentching there's a note to say "Yiru es Hashem"
silently.
Not a big deal, just something that stood out, as it's not mentioned in today's standard bentchers.

Next is a Seder Haftoros also printed in Copenhagen but from 1894. It has each week's haftorah along with the Danish
translation.
The first few pages are a list of names with the header "Subskribentfortegnelse" which seems to mean a writers list of
some sort
(google translate was no help; spelling must be off or maybe it needs to be broken down to multiple words?).
Both translations seem to have been originally done by Rabbi Abraham Alexander Wolf. You can see in the hebrew
introduction to the
siddur that his fathers name was Alexander.
