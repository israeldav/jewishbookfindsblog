<h1>
    Yiddish magazine printed in the DP camps in 1948
</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Below are some pages from a Yiddish magazine printed in the DP camps in 1948.
    It provides a very clear and unique insight to their day to day life - similar to picking up a newspaper today and
    flipping through it; you walk away with a straightforward snapshot of that day, not someone writing 50 years later
    trying to reconstruct a bygone era. Since it was a magazine though, the paper quality is terrible and it is really
    crumbling apart. When I bought this one there was an identical copy also available - don't know what I was thinking
    but I just took the nicer of the two and left the second one there. Live and learn.... The last page is an index of
    the articles in thisÂ issue. Overall it is very heartening to see the strength and courage that was displayed so soon
    after the war...</p>
<p></p>
<p>PS - There was no way this wasn't going to entirely fall apart if I kept it at home. I sent it to Amudai Aish in
    Brooklyn, hopefully they have some
    benefit from it.
