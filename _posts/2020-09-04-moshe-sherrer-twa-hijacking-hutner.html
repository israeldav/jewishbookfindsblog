<p>These notes byÂ Rabbi Moshe Sherer are from the commemorative album put out by Agudath Israel of America in 1999 -
    Rabbi Moshe Sherer, his life and his legacy. They detail Rabbi Sherer's efforts to get the last Jewish hostages of
    the 1970 TWA hijacking (<a

    home in time for Rosh Hashana.

Although this is not a particularly old book, it is a commemorative album which seems somewhat hard to come by. In
addition, I found the hour by hour narrative super fascinating.</p>
