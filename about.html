<p>The goal of this blog is to record and share pictures, notes and questions about <em>mostly</em> old, <em>mostly</em> Jewish and <em>mostly</em> books.

<p></p>
These are books I primarily findÂ at used book stores on the $1 or free shelf, at yard sales and flee markets as well as <a>href=https://www.ebay.com>Ebay</a>.</p>
